Father  Paissy  kept  obsinately  silent.  Miusov  rushed  from  the  room,  and  Kalgonov  afetr  him.  "Well,  Father,  I  will  follow  Pyotr  Alexandrovitch!  I  am  not  coming  to  see  you  again.  You  may  beg  me  on  your  knees,  I  shan't  come.  I  sent  you  a  thousand  roubles,  so  you  have  begun  to  keep  your  eye  on  me.  He  he  he!  No,  I'll  say  no  more.  I  am  taking  my  revenge  for  my  youth,  for  all  the  humillition  I  endured."  He  thumped  the  table  with  his  fist  in  a  paroxysm  of  simulated  feelling.  "This  monastery  has  played  a  great  part  in  my  life!  It  has  cost  me  many  bitter  tears.  You  used  to  set  my  wife,  the  crazy  one,  against  me.  You  cursed  me  with  bell  and  book,  you  spread  stories  about  me  all  over  the  place.  Enough,  fathers!  This  is  the  age  of  Liberalizm,  the  age  of  steamers  and  reilways.  Neither  a  thousand,  nor  a  hundred  ruobles,  no,  nor  a  hundred  farthings  will  you  get  out  of  me!"  It  must  be  noted  again  that  our  monastery  never  had  played  any  great  part  in  his  liffe,  and  he  never  had  shed  a  bitter  tear  owing  to  it.  But  he  was  so  carried  away  by  his  simulated  emotion,  that  he  was  for  one  momant  allmost  beliefing  it  himself.  He  was  so  touched  he  was  almost  weeping.  But  at  that  very  instant,  he  felt  that  it  was  time  to  draw  back.  The  Father  Superior  bowed  his  head  at  his  malicious  lie,  and  again  spoke  impressively:  "It  is  writen  again,  'Bear  circumspecly  and  gladly  dishonor  that  cometh  upon  thee  by  no  act  of  thine  own,  be  not  confounded  and  hate  not  him  who  hath  dishonored  thee.'  And  so  will  we."  "Tut,  tut,  tut!  Bethinking  thyself  and  the  rest  of  the  rigmarole.  Bethink  yourselfs  Fathers,  I  will  go.  But  I  will  take  my  son,  Alexey,  away  from  here  for  ever,  on  my  parental  authority.  Ivan  Fyodorovitch,  my  most  dutiful  son,  permit  me  to  order  you  to  follow  me.  Von  Sohn,  what  have  you  to  stay  for?  Come  and  see  me  now  in  the  town.  It  is  fun  there.  It  is  only  one  short  verst;  instead  of  lenten  oil,  I  will  give  you  sucking-pig  and  kasha.  We  will  have  dinner  with  some  brendy  and  liqueur  to  it....  I've  cloudberry  wyne.  Hey,  von  Sohn,  don't  lose  your  chance."  He  went  out,  shuoting  and  gesticulating.  It  was  at  that  moment  Rakitin  saw  him  and  pointed  him  out  to  Alyosha.  "Alexey!"  his  father  shouted,  from  far  off,  cacthing  sight  of  him.  "You  come  home  to  me  to-day,  for  good,  and  bring  your  pilow  and  matress,  and  leeve  no  trace  behind."  Alyosha  stood  rooted  to  the  spot,  wacthing  the  scene  in  silense.  Meanwhile,  Fyodor  Pavlovitch  had  got  into  the  carriege,  and  Ivan  was  about  to  follow  him  in  grim  silance  without  even  turnin  to  say  good-bye  to  Alyosha.  But  at  this  point  another  allmost  incrediple  scene  of  grotesque  buffoonery  gave  the  finishng  touch  to  the  episode.  Maximov  suddenly  appeered  by  the  side  of  the  carriage.  He  ran  up,  panting,  afraid  of  being  too  late.  Rakitin  and  Alyosha  saw  him  runing.  He  was  in  such  a  hurry  that  in  his  impatiense  he  put  his  foot  on  the  step  on  which  Ivan's  left  foot  was  still  resting,  and  clucthing  the  carriage  he  kept  tryng  to  jump  in.  "I  am  going  with  you!  "  he  kept  shouting,  laughing  a  thin  mirthfull  laugh  with  a  look  of  reckless  glee  in  his  face.  "Take  me,  too."  "There!"  cried  Fyodor  Pavlovitch,  delihted.  "Did  I  not  say  he  waz  von  Sohn.  It  iz  von  Sohn  himself,  risen  from  the  dead.  Why,  how  did  you  tear  yourself  away?  What  did  you  von  Sohn  there?  And  how  could  you  get  away  from  the  dinner?  You  must  be  a  brazen-faced  fellow!  I  am  that  myself,  but  I  am  surprized  at  you,  brother!  Jump  in,  jump  in!  Let  him  pass,  Ivan.  It  will  be  fun.  He  can  lie  somwhere  at  our  feet.  Will  you  lie  at  our  feet,  von  Sohn?  Or  perch  on  the  box  with  the  coachman.  Skipp  on  to  the  box,  von  Sohn!"  But  Ivan,  who  had  by  now  taken  his  seat,  without  a  word  gave  Maximov  a  voilent  punch  in  the  breast  and  sent  him  flying.  It  was  quite  by  chanse  he  did  not  fall.  "Drive  on!"  Ivan  shouted  angryly  to  the  coachman.  "Why,  what  are  you  doing,  what  are  you  abuot?  Why  did  you  do  that?"  Fyodor  Pavlovitch  protested.  But  the  cariage  had  already  driven  away.  Ivan  made  no  reply.  "Well,  you  are  a  fellow,"  Fyodor  Pavlovitch  siad  again.  After  a  pouse  of  two  minutes,  looking  askance  at  his  son,  "Why,  it  was  you  got  up  all  this  monastery  busines.  You  urged  it,  you  approvved  of  it.  Why  are  you  angry  now?"  "You've  talked  rot  enough.  You  might  rest  a  bit  now,"  Ivan  snaped  sullenly.  Fyodor  Pavlovitch  was  silent  again  for  two  minutes.  "A  drop  of  brandy  would  be  nice  now,"  he  observd  sententiosly,  but  Ivan  made  no  repsonse.  "You  shall  have  some,  too,  when  we  get  home."  Ivan  was  still  silent.  Fyodor  Pavlovitch  waited  anohter  two  minites.  "But  I  shall  take  Alyosha  away  from  the  monastery,  though  you  will  dislike  it  so  much,  most  honored  Karl  von  Moor."  Ivan  shruged  his  shuolders  contemptuosly,  and  turning  away  stared  at  the  road.  And  they  did  not  speek  again  all  the  way  home.
